# Hi 👋 I'm Tolga

I'm a **Computer Engineering student** who enjoys building things by learning them from the ground up.

I mainly work with **C**, **C++**, and **Python** at the moment, focusing on understanding how systems work at a low level rather than relying on heavy abstractions. Alongside my studies, I enjoy turning small ideas into structured projects and improving them step by step.

*"Why do we fall, Bruce? So that we can learn to pick ourselves up."*

## 🧠 What I'm currently focusing on

- Strengthening my fundamentals in **C and C++ programming**
- Building small but complete CLI projects
- Organizing my work into clean, readable GitHub repositories
- Writing code with clarity and intention, prioritizing correctness over complexity

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Build a strong foundation in systems programming
- Improve problem-solving skills through hands-on projects
- Create educational resources that other students can benefit from
- Treating GitHub as a long-term learning journal rather than a showcase :3
